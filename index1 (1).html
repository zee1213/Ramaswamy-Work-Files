<p>Pulp Fiction is an excellent action and crime drama movie. It revolves around two hit men, Jules and Vincent, <br> a mob gangster's wife, Mia, a boxer Butch and two diner bandits, Honey Bunny and Roger. It details all their <br> violent and exciting adventures. What I love the most about Pulp Fiction is the disjointed structure of the film - <br> showing different character's points of view in a twisted timeline. Though the movie displays the different <br> character experiences, all of the characters are linked: hitmen Jules and Vincent were hired by Mia's husband to <br> kill Butch. After Jules has a divine revelation, he gives up his life as a hitman and retires to a diner. At the diner, <br> he encounters Honey and Roger who attempt to rob the diner (which he convinces him not to). The different plots, <br> high intensity action and colorful multi-dimensional characters make Pulp Fiction one of my favorite movies of all time.  </p>
